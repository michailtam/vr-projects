# Performance Bounceback #
As an exercise of an Udacity project, I had to improve the performance of the given vr app. For this purpose I had to do improvements for:

* Batching
* Physics
* Memory management
* C# Code
* FPS
* Lighting

The most important thing I had to consider was the retainment of the 90 FPS for the HTC Vive headset.

The time it took to complete the project was round about 10 days.

## Conclusion ##
I liked the improvement of the memory management in the C# code, but I had some problems to bake the lightmaps properly. There is an issue after the baking process that keeps the scene dark. After doing a lot of changes in the inspector to delete this issue I didn't figure it out. So I disabled the shadows and after this the scene got lit properly but without any shadows. I have searched in the forums and newsgroups, but I didn't find any solution to this problem for the Unity version 5.5.0p3. Maybe this is a bug in this version.
