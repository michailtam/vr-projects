# Rube Goldberg Puzzles Challenge #

As an exercise of an Udacity project, I have created Windows VR game where the player has to solve different kinds of Rube Golberg puzzles. Using the two controllers he can navigate through the scene, spawn and move Rube Goldberg objects, and throw the ball. Releasing the ball outside of the platform is recognized by the system as cheating and the player has to start again. To complete the level he must also collect all the stars in the scene. 

## VR Developer ##
Michail Tamvakeras

## Tested HMD ##

The headset that was used was the HTC Vive and the VR game was developed under Windows 10.

## Development time ##
The time it took to develop and test the VR game was round about a month. This involved creating some 3D assets, too.

## Conclusion ##
One thing I liked was the implementation of the cheat prevention algorithm, and one thing that was challenging to me was the improvement of the game logic algorithms.
